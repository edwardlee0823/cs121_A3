COMPSCI 121 Assignment 3: M3 (Group #35) by Edward Lee and Richard Lee

List of 20 queries - 
Below 10 queries are good queries: 
1. iftekhar ahmed
2. machine learning
3. ACM
4. master of software engineering
5. artificial intelligence
6. deep learning
7. University of California Irvine
8. computer science
9. neural science
10. graduate programs

Below 10 queries are poorly performed queries (also how we fixed them): 
11. AI
12. ML
13. CS
Above queries are too short and since they are abbreviations, they might catch too many documents. Using weights on different HTML tags
have better the search result and performance.
14. what is the best thing of AI
15. how does machine learning affect the human
16. what is the benefit of coding
Above queries contain a lot of stop words and therefore causes irrelevant search results. We have also fixed this issue by increasing
weight on more important terms and not prioritizing the stop words.
17. how to use machine learning to scrape data with the use of artificial intelligence
18. the benefit of using neural networks to find the best data in terms of machine learning
Both queries above are too long and may contain too much content for the search to generate. We partitioned the index more concisely so that
we only load relevant sections to speed up the search time.
19. master's of software engineering
20. state-of-the-art in neural links
These queries above initially performed poor due to the usage of marks like apostrophe and hypens. And to fix this issue, we utilized better
tokenization to cut out unnecessary parts.
